Emotional Support Pickle (ESP)

A Meme Token With On-Chain Reward Utility

⸻

Abstract

Emotional Support Pickle (ESP) is a decentralized meme token designed to combine playful branding with on-chain reward mechanics. ESP enables holders to receive variable rewards generated from real trading activity rather than token emissions or inflationary minting. The project focuses on simplicity, transparency, and community-driven engagement.

ESP does not promise profits or guaranteed returns. All rewards are variable and dependent on on-chain activity, liquidity conditions, and market participation.

Introduction

Most meme tokens rely purely on hype or inflationary rewards. ESP introduces a lightweight utility layer by integrating reflection-style reward distribution sourced from real transactional volume.

The goal is to provide a fun, recognizable meme asset that also offers optional passive participation in on-chain activity, without requiring staking, lockups, or custodial control.
